"""
Application Layer Pipeline Stages

This package contains individual stage implementations for the microscopy
single-cell analysis pipeline. Each stage is responsible for a specific
part of the analysis workflow.

Stages:
- DataSelectionStage: Handles selection of conditions, regions, timepoints, and channels
- SegmentationStage: Manages cell segmentation using Cellpose or similar tools
- ProcessSingleCellDataStage: Processes individual cell data extraction
- ThresholdGroupedCellsStage: Handles thresholding for grouped cell analysis
- MeasureROIAreaStage: Measures regions of interest areas
- AnalysisStage: Performs final analysis and generates results
- CleanupStage: Cleans up intermediate files and directories
- CompleteWorkflowStage: Orchestrates the complete end-to-end workflow
